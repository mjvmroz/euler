Project Euler solutions. I am bad at both math and haskell, so this is likely to go poorly.
In general I am trying to solve things well mathematically and implement efficient algorithms
rather than just brute-force, though my resolve is frequently tested and broken.

In keeping with the rules of the project, only the first 100 solutions will be available here.
Assuming I actually get that far, I'll maintain a private fork for all past that point.

Solutions are [here](https://github.com/mirichan/euler/tree/master/src/Problems).
