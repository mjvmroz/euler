# euler

I am bad at both math and haskell so this is likely to go poorly.

In keeping with the rules of the project, only the first 100 solutions will be available here.
Assuming I actually get that far, I'll maintain a private fork for all past that point.

Solutions are [here](https://github.com/mirichan/euler/tree/master/src/Problems).
